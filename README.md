# FlowSketch

**FlowSketch** is an unconscious creation experience created by **[od3zza](https://github.com/od3zza)**.

> Through a browser extension that tracks mouse movements and clicks, FlowSketch enables the creation of unconscious art, which is formed over time by transforming user movements into different intensities and sizes of shapes. Right clicks become lines, dots, shapes, and distortions as random as the colors that are alternated with each left click. Today, we spend so much time hyper-focused, hyper-active, hyper-confused, and overwhelmed online, that small moments of pleasure, like painting or even resting our eyes and abstracting, disappear.
> Unconscious painting through this application is not necessarily an art technique or method, but a curious exploration of what we can unconsciously build, which uncovers so much of our behavior and emotions.
